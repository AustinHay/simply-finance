Simply Finance App [Powered by Yahoo! Finance]
==============================================

Description & Purpose
---------------------

App deployed on <a href="www.austinhay.com/simply-finance">Heroku</a>.

This is a small, simple finance web-app based on a Rack foundation and built in Sinatra. It's scrappy and essentially makes it easier to check the top stocks that are important to a user's portfolio. Grounded in Yahoo-finance GEM's and the Yahoo API, this app calls for recent stock metrics. Simple, easy, intuitive and super useful to monitor multiple stocks and their metrics in real-time.

This app is a great mechanism for understanding the Yahoo Finance API call system. I rely on GEMs created by others to make the process simpler, but they can be easily modified in order to understand how the API gets called.

Usage
